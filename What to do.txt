We take user requirements as input and based on certain deterministic rule sets, e create a pipeline custom fitted for his use.

The agentic part of this is not based on AI but on the prompts we give to the user and he selects an option as an output. 
It is wholly deterministic

The human will submit a form.

The agent will shortlist a few tools and provide them to the user as options (human in the loop)

The human can finalize the options and configure settings (additional prompts may be given if needed)


Step 1: Create the Agent (This is a form that will take inputs, lets make this a drop down), (This is also the questionairre portion)

Step 2: Create a backend logic that will determine the optimal pipeline tools (for each stage). And design the optimal pipeline

Step 3: Allow for user configuration and selection of the tools

Step 4: Test working of each and document data (all steps)
